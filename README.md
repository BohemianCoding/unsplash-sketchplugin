# Unsplash Data Plugin

## Features

- Get random image from Unsplash, using Sketch 52’s Data Supplier feature
- Open original URL for an image, if you click Plugins › Unsplash › View Photo on Unsplash (does not work for overrides yet)

## Issues

- We'll be effectively sharing our API key with the world. We need to double check with them that this is ok
- TODO: View Photo does not work for overrides
- TODO: use imageData directly once #19391 is implemented
