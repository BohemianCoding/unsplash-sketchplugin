# Unsplash Data Plugin

## Features

- Get random image from Unsplash, using Sketch 52’s Data Supplier feature
- Open original URL for an image, if you click Plugins › Unsplash › View Photo on Unsplash (does not work for overrides yet)

## Issues

- [ ] Images with multiple bitmap fills don't work as expected
- [ ] Show warning / help text when running the plugin on a layer that has no bitmap fill / is not supported
- [ ] View Photo does not work for overrides
- [ ] use imageData directly once #19391 is implemented
